FAQ
====

#### So how do I run this thing?

In order to use the plugin, activate it under `"Plugins"` menu and use a shortcode `[memeone_plugin]`.

#### Does this plugin store original images people upload?

No, it does not.

#### The font looks weird. It is different from the font I've seen on the most memes on the Internet.

The most commonly used font for memes is called Impact font. But unfortunately, I'm not allowed to redistribute it due to the licensing issues.  
However, you can purchase it yourself and use it on your website if you want to.
